# ⚔️ Encounter Types

## Logic Duel
Dialog-based or puzzle-style conflict; resolves via stat rolls and subsystem use.

## Subsystem Brawl
Turn-based combat against 1–3 enemies using terrain, traversal, and branching.

## Collapse Event
Hazard-based room — terrain or time itself shifts. Prioritizes fast thinking and Rebase.

## Lock Fork
Pick a subsystem (Patch, Force, Decrypt) to bypass node obstacle. Wrong choice may damage or debuff.

## Ghost Replay
Interact with a replay of a past event or version of yourself. May change outcome of present.

## Hackerspace
Safe node with ally NPCs, vendors, dialog trees.

## Branch Layer
Mini-boss or complex room with auto-suggested Branch point midway.
